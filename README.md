# Good Songs Growing Up

For my Foundations 23 Capstone Project, I made a full stack web application called **_Good Songs Growing Up_**. As the name suggests, *Good Songs Growing Up* features a collection of my favorite songs that I grew up with. Users will land on a homepage where they will find a description about the website.

Users will get a list of my favorite songs, sectioned off by when I heard it growing up (i.e Childhood, Teenage Years, College Years, and Today). Users will be able to navigate to different sections of the webpage using the provided navigation bar on the left.

Each song card will display a track title, artist, and a small description about why I thought the song was cool. Additionally, a Spotify player will be embedded within each song card so that users may listen to a 30-second snippet, if they wish.

Under the recommendations section, users can suggest their own recomendations to be added to a list for myself and other to hear. Input fields will require:
1. Title - for the title of the song
2. Artist - for the name of the artist
3. URL *(optional)* - for posting an external link of the song
4. Name - for the name of the user
5. Description - for why the user recommended the song

In addition to posting, recommendations can also be deleted. Simply click the "**_X_**" button in the top right corner to delete a post.

###### User Accounts
In the future, I would like to implement a way to incorporate user acccounts so that only the user can delete their own posts.

In the future, I would like to format the webpage to display properly on any screen size or aspect ratio.
