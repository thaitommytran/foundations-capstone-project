Project:
Good Songs Growing Up

Summary:
An application where you can get Thai's favorite songs growing up. Additionally, you can post your song recommendations for Thai (and others) to check out.

MVPs:
Users will land on the homepage where they will find a description about the website, a list of songs, and options for submitting recommendations.

Users can get a list of Thai's favorite songs, sectioned off by when he heard it growing up (e.g. Childhood, Teenage Years, College Years, and Today).

Under the recommendations section, users can list their own recomendations to be added to a list. Input fields will require a Title for the artist and song name, a YouTube URL of the song, and a short Description about why the user recommended the song. Recommendations can also be deleted.

The input box will move down to slot in new recommendations above.

Coding:
AXIOS requests will be used (GET, POST, DELETE).

Controller file will be used to store all the functions.

A database is required for the list of songs.
